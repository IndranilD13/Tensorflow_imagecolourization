# Tensorflow_imagecolourization
This is a interactive python notebook from kaggle based on the landscape-pictures dataset.This notebook explains about how to create a
deep learning model that does certain operation on input image and returns the new formed image . I have demonstrated this by colouring a
black and white image with the help of the model.Depending on the training data the model is flexible enough to adapt.
